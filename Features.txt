- my own shuffle algorithm will be using the weighted similarities
  - consider how to keep song from the same artists relatively different
  - trying to keep songs a bit more different in terms of everything so it feel "random"
  - maybe don't even need to separate artists all together
  - select couple of songs (couple could be calculate base on playlist size)
  - then find all the songs feel different compare to it, push them all in the first block of the playlist.
  - then trueshuffle all the songs within the block.
  - repeat until the entire playlist is shuffled.
  - since we are also swapping songs here, could create a more random effect as well.
