- Need to rethink about how I should utilized the JSON file I get from the api
    - either do everythinging in bash and put them into either txt file
    - or use bash to put them in a lighter JSON filer where all the resources I
      need will be in a single JSON file. The much heavier JSON file will be deleted
      at the end of the script which hopefully reduce physical memory usage.
        - then use Java to create the appropriate object base on those JSON file
        - required Java to read JSON file.
